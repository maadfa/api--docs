The client is the app that sends a request.For example, your phone\u2019s weather app asking for the latest forecast. The server is where the data is present, like a weather database. The client asks the server for information. The server receives the request, finds the data, and sends it back to the client. This helps apps and systems talk to each other and share information easily.</p>"},{"location":"delete/","title":"DELETE Request","text":"<p>DELETE \u2013 To Remove Data from the Server</p> <p>DELETE is used when you want to remove something from the server .It includes deleting a file, a user, or a saved alert.DELETE is a type of request used in REST APIs to remove or delete data from the server. When you send a DELETE request, you are telling the server to permanently erase a specific item, such as a user account, a post, or a saved alert. For example,  You can send DELETE request if you no longer need Bitcoin price alert your app.  The server would remove it from the database. DELETE requests usually don\u2019t need a body.It just needs the correct URL with the ID of the item to be deleted.

When you use a POST request, you're asking the server to create a new entry using the data you send. This is commonly used when you're creating a new user account, submitting a form, sending a message, or uploading a file. For example, when you sign up on a website, your name, email, and password are sent to the server through  POST request, and the server stores this as a new user record. While get gets data from server, POST actually saves new information to the server. POST requests usually carry data in the body.It is  often in JSON format.Post requests are a important part of most web and mobile applications that involve user input.</p>"},{"location":"put-patch/","title":"PUT \u2013 To Update or Replace Existing Data","text":"<p>PUT is a type of request used in REST APIs to update or replace existing data on the server.PUT  request adds new data and replace the previous one.For example, if you want to update your profile information like name, email, and phone number, the app sends a PUT request with all the updated details.

Unlike PUT, which replaces all of the data, PATCH is used when you only want to change one or two specific fields. For example, if a user wants to update just their email address without changing their name or phone number, a PATCH request is sent with only the new email. The server then updates only that part of the data,and rest of data remains the same. PATCH is helpful when you don\u2019t want to resend all the information.</p>"},{"location":"rest-api/","title":"What is REST?","text":"<p>REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
