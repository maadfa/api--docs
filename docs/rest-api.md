# What is REST?
REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is a way for computers (like your phone or laptop) to talk to each other over the internet. REST is mostly used when apps or websites need to get data from a server or send data to it.

## How REST Works
REST uses simple rules and methods to make communication easy. It works with the HTTP protocol, which is the same system used by websites.

Some common REST methods are:

GET 

POST 

PUT

PATCH 

DELETE
