# What Does “API” Stand For?

**APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)** are like bridges that let apps, websites, and devices talk to each other.

!!! note "API Explained"
    **A – Application:** A software program designed to do a specific task.  
    **P – Programming:** The logic or code that tells the application how to behave.  
    **I – Interface:** The point of interaction or connection between two software systems.

An API is an interface through which applications "talk" to each other by sending requests and receiving responses. These interactions occur by  following  rules or "protocols" present  in the API documentation.

# How does API work?

APIs work by connecting two parts of a system, the client and the server. The client is the app that sends a request.For example, your phone’s weather app asking for the latest forecast. The server is where the data is present, like a weather database. The client asks the server for information. The server receives the request, finds the data, and sends it back to the client. This helps apps and systems talk to each other and share information easily.
